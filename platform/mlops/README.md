# MLOps Platform

Hosts pipelines, registries, and monitoring utilities supporting ASTRA's machine learning lifecycle.

## Responsibilities
- Manage data preparation, training, evaluation, and deployment workflows.
- Track experiments, model versions, and approval status.
- Monitor model performance, drift, and fairness metrics post-deployment.

## Next Steps
1. Stand up MLflow/Kubeflow or equivalent stack for experiment tracking.
2. Define feature store interfaces and data validation gates.
3. Implement automated evaluation suite with guardrail metrics.
