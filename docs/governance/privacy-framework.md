# Privacy & Compliance Framework

## Regulatory Alignment
- Map data flows against GDPR, CCPA, and relevant national security statutes.
- Maintain records of processing activities (RoPA) for all datasets used within ASTRA.
- Define data residency and localization requirements per partner jurisdiction.

## Technical Controls
- Differential privacy mechanisms on shared analytics.
- Role-based and attribute-based access control (RBAC/ABAC) with least-privilege defaults.
- Encryption at rest and in transit, with hardware-backed key management where available.
- Automated data retention and deletion workflows.

## Operational Processes
1. **Data Intake Review** – Privacy officer approval, DPIA updates, and consent verification.
2. **Audit & Logging** – Immutable logs with blockchain or append-only ledger support.
3. **Breach Response** – Incident severity matrix, notification templates, and regulatory timelines.
4. **Partner Agreements** – Standardized data sharing terms, API quotas, and dispute resolution clauses.

## Metrics & Reporting
- Privacy risk score per dataset or integration.
- Time-to-close for privacy incidents.
- Quarterly compliance dashboard delivered to steering committee.

## Next Steps
- Stand up automated DPIA workflow integrated with issue tracker.
- Pilot differential privacy noise calibration on shared analytics feeds.
- Commission legal review for cross-border data sharing under current treaties.
