# Operations Playbooks

Centralize SOC runbooks, incident response procedures, red-team exercises, and deployment SLOs for ASTRA.

## Suggested Structure
- `runbooks/` – step-by-step operational guides and on-call checklists.
- `siem-playbooks/` – automation scripts and correlation rules for SIEM/SOAR tooling.
- `red-team/` – adversarial testing plans and simulation reports.

Update this space after each exercise or major release.
