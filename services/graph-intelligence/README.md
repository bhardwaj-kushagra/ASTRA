# Graph Intelligence Service

Analyzes propagation patterns, coordination clusters, and influence operations using graph analytics and GNNs.

## Responsibilities
- Construct dynamic actor-content graphs from ingestion streams.
- Apply Graph Neural Networks (GraphSAGE, GAT, etc.) for anomaly detection.
- Surface alerts and contextual insights to SIEM/SOAR integrations.

## Next Steps
1. Define graph schemas and node/edge feature sets.
2. Build training datasets with labeled campaigns for supervised tasks.
3. Benchmark GNN architectures for scalability and accuracy.
