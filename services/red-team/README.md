# Red-Team & Adversarial Simulation Service

Coordinates continuous adversarial testing against ASTRA's detection and response pipelines.

## Responsibilities
- Automate generation of adversarial samples (prompt attacks, style mutations).
- Run regression suites against detection models and track vulnerabilities.
- Share findings with vendor partners and governance committees.

## Next Steps
1. Define attack taxonomy and scoring rubric.
2. Integrate open-source adversarial toolkits (TextAttack, OpenAttack, etc.).
3. Establish disclosure workflow tied to remediation tasks.
