# Tooling & Automation Scripts

Place helper scripts, CLI utilities, and automation tooling used across ASTRA services.

## Suggestions
- Common data loaders and validation tools.
- Deployment aides (blue/green switchers, canary orchestrators).
- Developer productivity scripts (lint wrappers, local stack bootstrapping).

Document prerequisites and usage instructions within each script directory.
